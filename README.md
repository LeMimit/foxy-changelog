## Installation

It is recommanded to install this tool with [`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) to install it in a isolated environments:

```console
pipx install foxy-project
```

## Changelog generation

Runnning the following command in the working environment will generate the project's changelog according to its commit history.

```console
foxy-project changelog
```

### Add to an existing changelog

If you’d like to keep an existing changelog below your generated one, just add `<!-- foxy-changelog-above -->` to your current changelog.
The generated changelog will be added above this token, and anything below will remain.

> [!TIP]
> This is quite useful when changing the tag pattern (e.g. from semver to calendar) used to version a project or to help keeping an old manually generated changelog when integrated conventional commit to a project.

## Version management

`foxy-project` is providing support to automatically generate the version of your python project according to its commit history.

The management is based on [setuptools_scm](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm) and [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

As defined in the conventional commit specification:

>- The type `feat` MUST be used when a commit adds a new feature to your application or library.
>- The type `fix` MUST be used when a commit represents a bug fix for your application.

Runnning the following command in the working environment will print the project's version the according to its commit history.

```console
foxy-project version
```

`foxy-project` is providing two version schemas which control how the version is incremented.

### semver-conventional-commit-foxy

Based on [semver](https://semver.org/lang/fr/). Selected by default.

Rules:

- A commit with type `feat` activates an increment of the minor.
- All other types will activate an increment of the patch.

> [!NOTE]
> Breaking changes is not supported yet.

### calendar-conventional-commit-foxy

To manage version based on the calendar. The supported convention is YYYY.MM.Patch with Patch a number not 0-padded starting to 1. (example: 2024.01.1).

Rules:

- A commit with type `feat` activates an increment of the month.
- All other types will activate an increment of the patch version.
- The year is automatically incremented at the end a year.

## Configuration

`foxy-project` can be configured thanks to its command line or configuration files (`foxy-project.toml` or `pyproject.toml`).

Configurations files are automatically looked up in the project's folder but custom path can always to passed to the command line.

Configurations from different sources are considered with an defined order.
Commande line options overrides configurations from `foxy-project.toml` which overrides configurations from `pyproject.toml`.

### Python project

`pyproject.toml` is supported and is the recommanded way to configure python projects.

### Hatch

[Hatch](https://github.com/pypa/hatch) is supported out of the box thanks to [hatch-vcs](https://github.com/ofek/hatch-vcs).
Python projet using other project management tool can use `foxy-project` directly.

Ensure `hatch-vcs` and `foxy-project` are defined within the `build-system.requires` field in your `pyproject.toml` file.
All other options supported by `hatch-vcs` can be used. More information can be found in their documentation.

Usure to run `hatch version` instead of `foxy-project version` to avoid conflicts.

Only the version management is integrated into Hatch which will generate the good version at build time.

Changelog generation can be configured into a `tool.foxy-project.changelog` section.
If no title and description are provided for the changelog the one from `project` configuration are taken.

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling", "hatch-vcs", "foxy-project"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[tool.hatch.version]
source = "vcs"

[tool.hatch.version.raw-options]
version_scheme = "semver-conventional-commit-foxy"
local_scheme = "no-local-version"

[tool.foxy-project.changelog]
tag_pattern = "semver"
```

### Other projects

`foxy-project.toml` is the recommanded way.

The following configuration block can be added to the `foxy-project.toml` file.

```toml
[changelog]
tag_pattern = "semver"

[version]
local_scheme = "no-local-version"
```
